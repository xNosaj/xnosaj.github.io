            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorist and the Counter-Terrorists. Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing seperated objectives, the Terrorists, depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, while Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or rescue the hostages. There are eight game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode.</p>
